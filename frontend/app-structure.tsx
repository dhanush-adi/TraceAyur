Of
course.The
immersive
artifact
you
're referring to contains all the necessary code. I\'ll break down the purpose and content of each file for you.

### **1. Global Files: `layout.js` and `globals.css`**

* **`/app/globals.css`**: This file holds the basic styles that apply to your entire application. In this case, it sets the default font, background color, and basic link styling.
* **`/app/layout.js\`**: This is the root layout
for your entire app. It
's a special Next.js file that wraps around every page. It\'s where we import the `globals.css` file to ensure the styles are applied everywhere.

### **2. Landing Page: `/app/page.js`**

* **Purpose**: This is the homepage of your application (`http://localhost:3000/`).\
* **Content Code**: It's a simple React component that displays a header, an "About" section explaining the project, and a "Get Started" section. The key elements are the `<Link>` components from Next.js, which provide fast, client-side navigation to the login pages for each user role.

### **3. Manufacturer Pages**

* **`/app/manufacturer/login/page.js`**:\
    * **Purpose**: A simple login form
for manufacturers.\
    * **Content Code**
: It contains two input fields
for email and password. The
"Login\" button is a `<Link>` that navigates the user to the manufacturer's dashboard.
* **`/app/manufacturer/dashboard/page.js`**:\
    * **Purpose**: The main dashboard
for a logged-in manufacturer.\
    * **Content Code**
: It displays a welcome header and a list of products. The product list is a hardcoded array (\`
const products
`). The code uses the `.map()` function to loop through this array and render a display card for each product, showing its name, batch, and ingredients. It also includes a link to the "Generate QR Code" page.
* **`/app/manufacturer/generate-qr/page.js`**:
    * **Purpose**: Allows the manufacturer to generate a QR code for a product.
    * **Content Code**: This is a client component (\`'use client'\`) because it uses state (\`useState\`) to manage user interaction. It has a dropdown to select a product. When the "Generate" button is clicked, it constructs a URL and uses an external QR code API (\`api.qrserver.com\`) to create and display the QR code image.

### **4. Vendor & Warehouse Pages**

These follow a similar pattern to the manufacturer pages:

* **Login Pages** (`/vendor/login/page.js`, `/warehouse/login/page.js`): Simple forms that link to their respective dashboards.
* **Dashboard Pages** (`/vendor/dashboard/page.js`, `/warehouse/dashboard/page.js`): Welcome pages that provide links to the main actions for that role (e.g., "Scan Product" or "Scan Checkpoint").
* **Action Pages** (`/vendor/product-details/page.js`, `/warehouse/scan-checkpoint/page.js`): These pages simulate what happens after a QR code is scanned. They display hardcoded product data to show the information a vendor or warehouse manager would see at a specific point in the supply chain.

### **5. Customer Pages**

* **`/app/customer/scan-info/page.js`**:
    * **Purpose**: An instructional page for the end consumer.
    * **Content Code**: It simply tells the user how to scan a QR code and provides a sample link to simulate the experience.
* **`/app/customer/[productId]/page.js`**:
    * **Purpose**: This is the page the customer sees after scanning a QR code. It's a **dynamic route**.
    * **Content Code**: The `[productId]` in the folder name means it can handle any value (e.g., `/customer/1`, `/customer/2`, etc.). It uses the \`useParams\` hook from \`next/navigation\` to get the product ID from the URL. It then looks up that ID in a hardcoded \`traceabilityData\` object and displays the full journey of the product in a timeline format.

This covers the content and purpose of every file in the frontend structure. Let me know when you're ready to tackle the backend and smart contracts!
